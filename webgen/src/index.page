===============

{project_name:} is a code generator that produces the JNI code needed to implement java native methods.  It is based on the [jnigen](http://www.eclipse.org/swt/jnigen.php) code generator that is part of the SWT Tools 
project which is used to generate all the JNI code which powers the eclipse platform.

Features
--------

* JNI code generated declaratively from annotations on your java code
* Maven integration:
  * Generates JNI source code
  * Generates an autoconf and msbuild source project to build the native library. This gets attached to the maven project as as the native source zip file.
  * Builds the native source tar for the current platform
  * Built native library is stored in a platform specific jar.  This gets attached to the maven project as a platform specific jar file.

Introduction
------------

There are many open source JNI code generators available, but if your performance sensitive,
the code generator used by the eclipse SWT project is by far the best option.  The biggest 
problem is that it was not developed to be reused by other projects.  It was tightly coupled
to producing the SWT jni libraries and it could only be run within the eclipse platform.

HawtJNI has taken that code generator and made it easier to use and accessible to more projects.
