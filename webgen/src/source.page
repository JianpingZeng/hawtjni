# Source Repository

The *{project_name:}* project stores its source code in a [Git](http://git-scm.com/) repository hosted on [github](http://github.com) at this location:

* [{project_git_browser:}]({project_git_browser:})

If you are new to Git you might like to try the [Git guide for subversion users](http://git.or.cz/course/svn.html) or have a look at the [Git community book](http://book.git-scm.com/).

You can [browse the repository online]({project_git_browser:}) if you prefer.

## How to Checkout

Read only access to the repository is available at the following URL:

* **{project_git_url:}**

You must first install a [Git client](http://git-scm.com/download). Then you clone the repository using the following:

    git clone {project_git_url:}
    cd {project_id:}
